# Fork from [clevercoffee-hardware](https://github.com/rancilio-pid/clevercoffee-hardware)

Forked because I want to improve the routing of the minimal PCB. Original Readme:

# CleverCoffee Hardware 

<br>

KiCAD projects for breakout boards based on the ESP32 DevKitC v4 

* Minimal PCB with a smaller footprint and all unused GPIO-Pins on a separate header
* Development PCB with additional support for rotary encoder and dimmer circuit
* Experimental SMD variant of the minimal PCB with additional headers for the optional brew and steam LEDs
* Experimental SMD variant of the development PCB with a smaller footprint and wider spacing of the headers to be able to mount JST XH plugs

<br>
If you want to order PCBs yourself please keep in mind that the development boards are still a work in progress. The pinmapping for the features that are not yet on the minimal PCB is subject to change at any time.
<br>
<br>
For the latest revision of the minimal PCB just write us a message on our Discord.
<br>
<br>
If you want to create your own hardware based on our designs, please contact us beforehand to make sure you're not developing against an outdated revision. There may be unpublished changes not yet available in the repository.<br>
Also note that for regulatory and safety reasons we are not interested in designs with components operating at mains voltage.
